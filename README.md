ProjectTing
===========

A game written in C++ using SFML.  I realized after working on it for some time that I was essentially writing a game engine (and doing a terrible job at it), so I stopped.  I learned a lot while working on it, though, so I'm keeping it here for portfolio reasons.

WASD - move
Left mouse button - shoot
Mouse scroll wheel - zoom camera

It's got multiplayer, too!
